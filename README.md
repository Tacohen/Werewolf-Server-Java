Werewolf-Server-Java
====================

A serever-side implementation of the mafia-style game Werewolf. This is written in Spring Framework, with database storage being handled by PostgreSQL.

Testing scripts (in Python) are located in the Tests folder. Test.py is the main testing script, and the one that should be used when evaluting. The other Python scripts may not work, as they have not been updated to keep pace with URL mapping changes

Currently deployed at powerful-depths-2851.herokuapp.com
